# Cryptic Canvas: RSA Encryption Suite

## Introduction
Cryptic Canvas is a web-based RSA Encryption Suite designed to provide robust, secure, and easy-to-use encryption and decryption functionalities. This application uses Flask for the backend and basic HTML with Bootstrap for the frontend, delivering a responsive user interface.

## Features
- **RSA Key Generation:** Dynamically generates RSA key pairs for encryption and decryption.
- **Encryption/Decryption:** Allows users to encrypt plaintext messages and decrypt ciphertext using generated keys.
- **Multi-layered Security:** Utilizes multiple RSA key pairs to enhance security through layered encryption and decryption.

## Tech Stack
- **Flask:** Serves the backend application and handles all cryptographic operations.
- **HTML/CSS:** Structures and styles the frontend.
- **JavaScript and jQuery:** Manages asynchronous requests and dynamic content updates.
- **Bootstrap:** Ensures responsive design.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Flask
- An internet browser

### Setting Up Locally
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/hetvi3012/Cryptic-Canvas-RSA-Encryption-Suite.git

   cd Cryptic-Canvas-RSA-Encryption-Suite
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install flask

3. **Run the application:**
   ```sh
   python app.py



## Usage

1. **Generate RSA Keys:** Navigate to the home page and click on 'Generate Keys' to start the process of key generation.
2. **Encrypt a Message:** Enter your message in the 'Encrypt Message' section and submit it to receive the encrypted message.
3. **Decrypt a Message:** Input your encrypted message in the 'Decrypt Message' section and submit to view the original message.
